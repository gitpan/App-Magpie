    $ eval $( magpie co -s perl-Foo-Bar )
    $ magpie fixspec

    # to get list of available options
    $ magpie help fixspec


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command will update a spec file from a perl module package, and
make sure it follows a list of various policies. It will also update the
list of build prereqs, according to F<META.yml> (or F<META.json>)
shipped with the distribution.

Note that this command will abort if it finds that the spec is too much
outdated (eg, not using C<%perl_convert_upstream_version>)
